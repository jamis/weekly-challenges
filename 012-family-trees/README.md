# Weekly Challenge #12: Family Trees and Pedigree Charts

http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2016/10/15/weekly-programming-challenge-12.html

Time is still tight and things are still crazy (house is in process of being unpacked and organized), so I went with Ruby again. The pedigree chart is generated as a PDF (courtesy of the awesome Prawn library), and is sourced from a hard-coded (and randomly-generated) tree of names. Running the `pedigree.rb` program generates a `pedigree.pdf` file, showing all seven generations of hard-coded names. :)
