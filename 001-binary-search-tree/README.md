# Weekly Challenge #1: Binary Search Tree

https://medium.com/@jamis/weekly-programming-challenge-1-55b63b9d2a1 -- _hard mode_

My (hard mode) submission is an implementation of an AVL Tree--a kind
of self-balancing binary search tree.

As per hard-mode requirements, this implementation:
* supports arbitrary data as keys (out-of-the-box if the data responds to the <=> operator, otherwise you can supply a "comparison" function to specify how the keys should be compared)
* supports insert options
* supports search options
* supports delete options
* implements a self-balancing binary tree
