# Weekly Challenge #11: Drawing Circles

http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2016/10/8/weekly-programming-challenge-11.html

Time was tight this week, as we're moving to another house (just a few blocks away, but still, moving is moving!). Thus, in order to save time, I went with a Ruby implementation, and just did the bare minimum--drawing a circle using the midpoint circle algorithm.

It uses ChunkyPNG to generate the image.

```sh
$ ruby circles.rb
```

This will generate `circles.png` image, showing the resulting circle.
