# Weekly Challenges

These are (my) solutions to my weekly programming challenges. They are
not guaranteed to be optimal, or even correct, and are provided more as
proof that I'm actually learning something than out of any attempt to
help others. Still, if any of this can be helpful to someone else, so
much the better!

The challenges are:

1. Binary Search Tree -- https://medium.com/@jamis/weekly-programming-challenge-1-55b63b9d2a1
2. Grammar-Based Name Generation -- https://medium.com/@jamis/weekly-programming-challenge-2-33ef134b39cd
