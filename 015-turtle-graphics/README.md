# Weekly Challenge #15: Turtle Graphics

http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2016/11/05/weekly-programming-challenge-15.html

Back to Ruby this week, for the sake of familiarity. Turtle graphics are super fun to play with! My submission this week hit several of the "hard mode" points, which turned out to be anything but actually "hard". :)

The code itself is in `turtle.rb`. The other files are sample scripts that use the `Turtle` class to draw patterns.
